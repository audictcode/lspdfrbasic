        The default codes are as seen in the National UK Police Airwave standard.
        It represents most forces in the UK, although if you're not in the UK - these
        probably won't be realistic in the area you're simulating. If such is the case,
        you can reconfigure this file until it matches the style of gameplay you'd like.
        
        Be aware that not *all* of the UK police codes are here, I've removed some such as 
        Confidentiam Message (12), Urgent and Non-Urgent callbacks (13 and 14), and Repeat (16)
        just because I can't find a use for them here - but if you want to add them, fill your
        boots :)
