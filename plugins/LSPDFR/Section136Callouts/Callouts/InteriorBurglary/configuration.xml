    You can set the different ped models that appear in this callout here.
  
    There's a single "type" attribute, which designates whether the ped model can appear as a victim, or as a suspect.
  
      victim    ->  The model can occur as a victim.
      suspect   ->  The model can appear as a suspect.
    
    If the type says anything other than "victim" or "suspect", the model will not be registered and will not show up in the game.
  
    If you do not designate the "type" attribute, the model will not be registered and will not show up in the game.
