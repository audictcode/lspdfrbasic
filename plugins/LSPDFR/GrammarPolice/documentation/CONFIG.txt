Do NOT modify the GrammarPolice/default.ini configuration file.  Instead, create a custom.ini file
in the same folder.  You can do this by copying the entire default.ini file or you can add just the
settings you want to change.

If you modify the default.ini, your changes will be wiped out by future updates.  If you use a
custom.ini file, your changes will be preserved.  The configuration folder:
