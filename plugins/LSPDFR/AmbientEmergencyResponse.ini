//These settings adjust the probability for a given type of response to occur

//All of the below sections are to adjust the creation of multi-unit responses, respective to their city/county and emergency vehicle type

//The [City] section will be used when the Player is within City limits, while the [County] section will be used when the Player is within County limits

//MutliUnitProbability - The probability that a multi-unit response will be generated; Value: 0 (never) - 100 (always)

//MaxPossibleUnits - The maximum number of units to create for a multi-unit response; Suggested value > 2; If value is less than 2, then it will essentially be a single unit response; If value is 2, then it will always be a two-unit response

//For [Mixed] section, it will always generate a multi-unit response, based upon the probability values in the [Probability] section; For example, if PoliceResponse=45, MedicResponse=45, and FireResponse=10, then the Mixed response type will consist primarily of police and medic units, with a low chance of a fire unit
